# Local-Search

## Project Description

This project focuses on solving two classical combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Knapsack Problem, using local search algorithms.

### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The TSP aims to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

### Knapsack Problem

The Knapsack Problem involves selecting a subset of items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack.
